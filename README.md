# Apple Music Discord Activity
A lightweight Rust project to set Discord Activity to currently listening Apple Music track.
Main goal of this project is to join two of my libraries to achieve it.

### Please note that the project is not finished yet!


## Next steps
- Split main.rs into modules
- Have the program run in background
- Do not set an activity if Apple Music is not running
